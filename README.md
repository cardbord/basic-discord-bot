# basic-discord-bot
a helping hand to people starting with the discord.py wrapper

features:
a test command 'hello' just to make sure everything's running smoothly, the bot will simply respond to the command with "hey there!",

a choice command that picks one argument at random from the user's two submitted arguments,

an avatar command that displays the requested user's profile picture (if no one is selected, it will default to the command author)

a purge command (staff only, change the has_role("Starff") to whatever staff role your server may have) to clear the given message count

and an example listener that will respond to any message that starts with "hello bot" with "Hello there (user), how's your day going?"
